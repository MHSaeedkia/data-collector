## Requirement: consolidated order book per pair+side

For each `{pair}-{side}` we must **generate a consolidated order book** that merges
the order book data of all exchanges for that pair+side into a single stream.

Desired output streams (one per pair+side, exchanges merged in) — topic `{side}-p{pair_id}`:

```
asks-p2    # BTC-USDT asks
bids-p2    # BTC-USDT bids
asks-p7    # another pair
bids-p7
...
```

## Two layers of "merge"

1. **Transport merge (done)** — the Kafka source already pulls all exchange topics
   for a pair+side into one DataStream via regex `{side}-p{pair_id}-ex.*`. See
   [[kafka-topic-strategy]].
2. **Stateful generation (this requirement)** — on top of that merged stream, build
   and emit a consolidated order book. Plan: `keyBy(pairId)` → keep latest snapshot
   per exchange in keyed state → merge into one book on each event → emit
   `{side}-p{pair_id}` stream.

## Resolved: merge semantics (UNION, do NOT combine quantities)

Union all exchanges' levels and sort by price; do **not** sum quantities at equal price.
Each output level keeps its own exchange. Equal-price levels from different exchanges
appear as separate, adjacent entries.

Example — BTC-USDT asks:
- nobitex: qty 10 @ 100000
- wallex:  qty 4  @ 100000

Output is NOT `qty 14 @ 100000`; it is two adjacent entries:
- `{ exchange: nobitex, qty: 10, price: 100000 }`
- `{ exchange: wallex,  qty: 4,  price: 100000 }`

Rules:
- Asks sorted ascending by price; bids descending (highest first).
- Tie-break at equal price (different exchanges): larger quantity first.
- Price and quantity compared as `BigDecimal` (decimal strings; avoid float error).
- Output model: new `ConsolidatedOrderBook { pair_id, side, levels }` where each level is
  `{ exchange_id, price, quantity }` (`exchange_id` is the int DB id, not the name).
  `OrderBookEvent`/`PriceLevel` can't be reused as-is because the exchange must live on each level,
  not the envelope.

**Why:** This is the core business value of the pipeline — a single normalized,
cross-exchange order book view per trading pair and side, rather than fragmented
per-exchange snapshots.
**How to apply:** Implement as a keyed stateful operator (`KeyedProcessFunction<Integer,…>` keyed by
`pairId`, `MapState<Integer, ExchangeBook>` keyed by `exchange_id` holding a maintained running book
per exchange — see the Phase 3 section for the state shape and snapshot/update handling) between the
Kafka sources and the sink in `OrderBookJob`. On each event, apply it to that exchange's book,
rebuild the union, sort by price, and emit a `ConsolidatedOrderBook`.

## Decision: DataStream (Java), not Flink SQL

**Q:** Why is `OrderBookMerger` implemented in pure Java (DataStream API) instead of Flink SQL?

**A:** The merge produces, per `(pair, side)`, a single row holding a **nested array of
`{exchange, price, quantity}` levels sorted by a custom comparator**, recomputed on every
update. That is three things Flink SQL handles poorly on a streaming changelog:

1. **Nested array output** — you'd `UNNEST` each exchange's `levels`, then re-collect into one
   sorted array per group; Flink SQL has no clean "sorted `ARRAY_AGG`" for continuous streams.
2. **Custom sort** — price asc/desc by side + tie-break by quantity desc, as `BigDecimal`;
   expressible row-wise but not as "sort the array inside the row".
3. **Latest-per-exchange state** — SQL *can* do this (`ROW_NUMBER() … PARTITION BY exchange`
   + dedup), but it's the easy part.

The `KeyedProcessFunction` does all three in ~30 lines with explicit state and a `Comparator`.
SQL would be more code, less readable, and hit engine limits — the opposite of what SQL buys you.

Precision on "can't": it's "can't *cleanly/efficiently* on a streaming changelog," not a hard
impossibility. A custom UDAF (`AggregateFunction` returning a sorted array) could force it — but
that re-implements the same Java logic wrapped in SQL, so the DataStream operator is strictly simpler.
The blocker is specifically the **sorted-array-inside-one-row** shape: streaming `ARRAY_AGG` takes no
per-group `ORDER BY`, and SQL `ORDER BY` sorts rows, not elements within an aggregated array.

Rule of thumb for the whole pipeline: **imperative / stateful / array-shaped → DataStream;
declarative / windowed / analytical → SQL.** Flink SQL would earn its place later for analytics
(OHLC/candles, VWAP, windowed depth/liquidity, top-N) as *separate* jobs, not for this merge.

## Implemented (Phase 1)

- `model/ConsolidatedLevel.java` — `{ exchange_id, price, quantity }` (`exchange_id` int, serialized as `exchange_id`)
- `model/ConsolidatedOrderBook.java` — `{ pair_id, side, levels, eventTime }` (eventTime = max of contributing snapshots)
- `aggregation/OrderBookMerger.java` — `KeyedProcessFunction<Integer,…>` (keyed by pairId); `MapState<Integer, OrderBookEvent>` (keyed by exchange_id) — **note: in Phase 3 this state value changed to `ExchangeBook`, see the Phase 3 section below**;
  comparator = price (asc asks / desc bids) then quantity desc, both `BigDecimal`
- `OrderBookJob.addStream` wires `source → keyBy(pairId) → OrderBookMerger(side)` then fans out to
  TWO sinks: a Kafka sink to topic `{side}-p{pair_id}` (e.g. `asks-p2`) AND `print(name)` to stdout
  (operator/print/topic names all use `{side}-p{pair_id}`)
- `serializer/ConsolidatedOrderBookSerializer.java` — Jackson `SerializationSchema`, transient ObjectMapper
- `sink/OrderBookSinkFactory.java` — `KafkaSink<ConsolidatedOrderBook>`; builder default `DeliveryGuarantee.NONE`
  (we don't reference `DeliveryGuarantee` directly — `flink-connector-base` isn't on the compile classpath)
- No feedback loop: output topic `{side}-p{pair_id}` does NOT match source pattern `{side}-p{pair_id}-ex.*`
  (the `-ex` segment is required), so the job won't re-consume its own output
- `ConsolidatedOrderBook.eventTime` serializes as `event_time` (matches `OrderBookEvent` snake_case convention)
- Flink 2.x note: operator uses `open(OpenContext)` (the 1.x `open(Configuration)` was removed in Flink 2.0)
- Functional test: `scripts/produce-test-data.sh` STREAMS randomized snapshots (random
  pair/side/exchange each tick, prices drifting around a mid via awk, pauses on some steps)
  for `DURATION_SECONDS` (default 600) to show live UI updates — not a fixed batch
- Flink source is now fully commented (2026-06-29): every class has a Javadoc role
  line; the end-to-end pipeline overview lives in `OrderBookJob`'s class doc. Key
  rationales captured inline — no watermarks (event-driven, not windowed), rebuild
  book from scratch each event, state+comparator built in `open()` not the
  constructor (MapState is per-key, Comparator isn't Serializable), latest offsets
  (live book not replay), and the `-ex` regex segment is what blocks the feedback loop.
- `scripts/warmup.sh` provisions BOTH input topics (`{side}-p{pair_id}-ex{exchange_id}`, per subscribed
  exchange) AND output topics (`{side}-p{pair_id}`, one per distinct subscribed pair) — single partition each.
  (both warmup.sh and the Flink job use the ID-based scheme as of 2026-06-28 — see [[kafka-topic-strategy]])

## Implemented: snapshot + update event support (Phase 3 — 2026-06-29)

The merger now honours the `type` field instead of treating every event as a full snapshot
(see [[avro-schema-orderbook]]).

**Decided semantics (NiFi guarantees these):**
- `snapshot` → replace that exchange's book wholesale.
- `update`   → apply on top of existing book, per level: `quantity > 0` → insert-or-overwrite that
  price level; `quantity == 0` → delete it. Compare zero via `BigDecimal.compareTo(ZERO)`, never string `"0"`.

This is *within* one exchange's stream; the cross-exchange union/sort/no-summing logic is unchanged.

**Merger state (implemented):** `MapState<Integer, OrderBookEvent>` → `MapState<Integer, ExchangeBook>`
where new `model/ExchangeBook.java` is a Flink POJO `{ NavigableMap<BigDecimal price, String qty> levels,
long eventTime, long lastSeq }`. `processElement`: look up the exchange's book; drop stale/dup
(`book != null && seq <= lastSeq` — first event per exchange always accepted); branch on `type`
(`SNAPSHOT` → fresh book, put all levels; else → mutate book, `BigDecimal.ZERO.compareTo(qty)==0`
removes the price key, else upsert; empty book created if none yet); set eventTime/lastSeq; put back.
Then rebuild-union-sort-emit exactly as before, but iterating `booksByExchange.entries()` and the
per-book map (exchange_id comes from the outer map key; output price = `key.toPlainString()`;
maxEventTime over stored books).

`ExchangeBook.levels` is keyed by **`BigDecimal` price, and MUST be a `TreeMap`** (2026-06-29): TreeMap
keys by `BigDecimal.compareTo`, so `"97240.50"` and `"97240.5"` collapse to one level. NiFi gives **no
guarantee** that snapshot and update use the same string formatting for a price, so we can't key by the
raw string. A `HashMap<BigDecimal,…>` would be wrong — `BigDecimal.equals`/`hashCode` are scale-sensitive.
Output price is normalized via `toPlainString()` (so display drops trailing zeros, e.g. `97240.50`→`97240.5`,
`600.00`→`600`). Compiles clean (`mvn -q compile`).

**Sequence id (mandatory, done):** `sequence_id` (`long`, required) added to `schemas/orderbook_event.avsc`,
example JSON, and `OrderBookEvent.sequenceId`; NiFi must populate it. Used now only for stale/duplicate drop.

**Sequence jump (field added 2026-06-29):** `sequence_jump` (`long`, required) added to
`schemas/orderbook_event.avsc`, example JSON, and `OrderBookEvent.sequenceJump`. NiFi now populates it.
Resolves the old "is `sequence_id` contiguous +1?" question below: **NO — increments are not +1**; some
exchanges jump by ~300 between consecutive updates, so `sequence_jump` carries the expected per-message
increment (delta from the previous message for that exchange). Gap-detection logic is now implemented —
see the gap-handling section below. Confirmed semantic: an update is in order iff
`seq == lastSeq + sequence_jump`.

### DEFERRED — cold start (revisit later)
**Verified 2026-06-29: NO Flink checkpointing/state backend is configured** — `docker-compose.yml`
only sets `jobmanager.rpc.address` + `taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots`. So keyed state is in-memory and
lost on every restart. Fine for snapshot-only (next snapshot rebuilds), but with deltas a restart leaves
the book empty until the next snapshot. **Current assumption to unblock Phase 3:** the first event per
exchange from Kafka is a `snapshot`, so a base book always exists before any `update`; no gating yet.
Fix options for later: (A) Flink checkpoints+savepoints with a durable state backend [recommended,
idiomatic, no merger code]; (B) log-compact output topic `{side}-p{pair_id}` (key = topic name) + reseed
on startup — also gives downstream consumers (web UI) the current book instantly; (C) both. Also deferred:
the "ignore updates until first snapshot per exchange" gate (for a truly empty / brand-new deploy).

### DONE — sequence-id gap handling (2026-06-29)
Increments are NOT +1 — exchanges can jump (~300) — so each event carries `sequence_jump` (the expected
delta from the previous message). `OrderBookMerger.processElement` now validates per-exchange continuity:

- **snapshot** → accepted unconditionally (NO seq check — it IS the baseline); replaces the book, stores
  `lastSeq = sequence_id`, and clears `awaitingSnapshot`. This is also the only way to recover from a gap
  and the only way an exchange's book is first created (so cold-start "first event is a snapshot" is now
  enforced, not just assumed — a leading `update` is ignored).
- **update** → must validate against a trusted baseline:
  - `book == null` or `book.awaitingSnapshot` → ignore (no baseline yet / waiting to resync).
  - `seq <= lastSeq` → stale/duplicate, drop.
  - `seq > lastSeq + sequence_jump` → **real gap (missed messages)**: clear the book's levels + set
    `awaitingSnapshot = true`, then re-emit (that exchange drops out of the consolidated book) and wait
    for the next snapshot. Chosen action: **drop-book-and-resync** (user decision; safe/standard — never
    serve a drifted book), not apply-anyway.
  - else (`seq == lastSeq + sequence_jump`) → in order: apply deltas (qty>0 upsert / qty==0 delete),
    advance `eventTime`/`lastSeq`.

New state: `ExchangeBook.awaitingSnapshot` (boolean) gates updates after a gap until a snapshot resets it.
Generator (`fake-data-generator/mian.go`) sends ONLY snapshots with `sequence_jump = 0`, so the update/gap
path is exercised by real NiFi data, not the dev generator. Compiles clean (`mvn -q compile`).
NOTE: cold-start on a *restart* is still unprotected — no Flink checkpointing (see cold-start section);
in-memory state is lost on restart and only rebuilds once each exchange sends a fresh snapshot.

Status: plan agreed; schema edit (`sequence_id`) pending because it's a shared contract with the NiFi
team. Tracked in `todo.md` Phase 3.
