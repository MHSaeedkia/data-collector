## Decision: Topic per side+pair+exchange (ID-based names)

**Input topic** → `{side}-p{pair_id}-ex{exchange_id}` (e.g. `asks-p2-ex1`, `bids-p2-ex1`)
**Output topic** → `{side}-p{pair_id}` (e.g. `asks-p2`) — Flink writes the consolidated book here
**Key** → null (one exchange per input topic guarantees ordering)
**Body** → see [[avro-schema-orderbook]] (base, quote, pair_id, exchange_id, exchange_name, side, type, event_time, levels)

`pair_id` = `markets.id`, `exchange_id` = `exchanges.id`. Topic names use the **DB integer IDs**, not the human-readable base/quote/exchange_name. Side comes first.

## Rationale

- One exchange publishes to one input topic — ordering is guaranteed with a single partition, no key needed
- Partition count is 1 per topic; no skew, no idle partitions, no repartitioning when exchanges are added or removed
- Flink aggregates across exchanges via regex on input topics: `{side}-p{pair_id}-ex.*` (e.g. `asks-p2-ex.*`) picks up all exchanges for that side+pair automatically — new exchanges need no Flink config change
- Output topic `{side}-p{pair_id}` is a prefix of the input names, but the required `-ex` segment keeps it out of the input regex, so the job won't re-consume its own output (no feedback loop)
- IDs keep topic names compact and decoupled from display strings (avoids casing/charset issues). `exchanges.name` is unique and immutable (README RULE) so names would also be stable, but IDs are shorter
- Topic count at scale: 10 exchanges × 200 pairs × 2 sides = 4000 topics — fine for modern Kafka (KRaft)

## Migration note (changed 2026-06-28)

Topic naming was changed from human-readable to ID-based. **`scripts/warmup.sh`, `schemas/orderbook_event.avsc`, and the Flink job are migrated (Flink compiles); the web app is NOT yet.**

Old scheme: input `{base}-{quote}-{side}-{exchange_name}` (e.g. `BTC-USDT-asks-nobitex`), output `{base}-{quote}-{side}` (e.g. `BTC-USDT-asks`).

Flink job migration (done): Flink works **only with `pair_id` and `exchange_id`** — `base`, `quote`, `exchange_name` were removed from all Flink models. `OrderBookEvent` keeps `exchange_id`, `pair_id`, `side`, `type`, `event_time`, `levels` and is annotated `@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown=true)` so it tolerates the descriptive fields the wire JSON still carries (the avsc schema is unchanged). `PairsLoader` selects only `m.id` into `Pair(id)`. `OrderBookSourceFactory` subscribes by regex `{side}-p{pairId}-ex.*`. `OrderBookJob` keys by `pairId` and names operators + sink topic `{side}-p{pair_id}`. `OrderBookMerger` is `KeyedProcessFunction<Integer,…>` with `MapState<Integer,…>` keyed by `exchange_id`. `ConsolidatedOrderBook` = `{ pair_id, side, levels, event_time }`; `ConsolidatedLevel` = `{ exchange_id, price, quantity }`.

Still on the old scheme (must be updated or the pipeline won't connect):
- `web/server.js` — matches output topics with `^.+-(asks|bids)$`; output topics now START with side, so this no longer matches. Needs e.g. `^(asks|bids)-p\d+$` (output) vs `^(asks|bids)-p\d+-ex\d+$` (input).

## What was rejected and why

| Option | Rejected because |
|---|---|
| `asks` / `bids` as topics, pair as key | Flink streams not separated by pair |
| `{pair}` as topic, side as key | Flink still needs `filter()` to split sides; only 2 effective partitions |
| `{pair}-{side}` as topic, exchange as key | Partition count doesn't align with exchange count per pair; varies per topic and changes over time |

## Out of scope (deferred)

Processing all pairs for one exchange (e.g. everything from `nobitex`) is not a current requirement. If needed later, a separate stream can be defined for that use case.

## Operational note

Topics are pre-provisioned by `scripts/warmup.sh` from the postgres `markets` + `exchange_markets` + `exchanges` tables (rows where `exchange_markets.status = 'subscribe'`) — not auto-created. warmup.sh first registers the Avro schema, then creates input + output topics (single partition, replication-factor 1).

**Why:** NiFi → Kafka → Flink pipeline for collecting and normalizing exchange order book data (asks + bids) across up to 200 trading pairs.
**How to apply:** Use this structure for all Kafka topic definitions, NiFi routing logic, and Flink source configurations in this project.
